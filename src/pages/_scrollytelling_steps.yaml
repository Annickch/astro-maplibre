  description: This study examines the alignment of public transit supply and demand in New York City to identify transit desertsâ€”areas with limited subway access despite high demand. Using GIS analysis, it integrates data on subway routes, stations, and demographics to highlight accessibility gaps and provide insights for improving transit equity and efficiency.

  description: Using Z-scores, the attributes were standardized, and manually assigned weights prioritized their relative importance, 0.6 for accessibility and 0.4 for route count in supply, and 0.3 for working-age population and 0.7 for transit-dependent commuters in demand. The indices were normalized, and the final transit gap value was calculated as the difference between normalized supply and demand indices. Areas identified as transit deserts include neighborhoods like Tottenville in Staten Island, Canarsie in southeast Brooklyn, Laurelton in eastern Queens, and Eastchester in the Bronx. These regions are highlighted in red, indicating high transit demand with insufficient supply. Staten Island and eastern Queens face limited subway access, relying heavily on buses or costlier commuter rail options, while southeast Brooklyn and parts of the Bronx have gaps in transit infrastructure or overcrowded services, exacerbating accessibility challenges for residents.
